declare an object that belong to Mino_T class,called t and tp(pointer)
declare another object that belong to Mino_block class,called b and bp(pointer)
then paint the t and b,and make tp=&t, bp=*b
paint the pointers

then switch the object that pointers point to-> tp = &b, bp = &t
paint the pointers in the result of this change

then rotate the object that pointer point to
paint them
